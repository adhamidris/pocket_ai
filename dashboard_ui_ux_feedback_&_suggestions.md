# Dashboard UI/UX Feedback & Suggestions

Audience: Non‑technical business owners and team members
Author: Senior UI/UX Consultant
Scope: Mobile app → Dashboard section and its components

## Executive Summary

The dashboard currently surfaces many elements at once (KPIs, alerts, onboarding, quick actions, assistant panels, insights, industry tiles, banners). While individually useful, their simultaneous presence creates cognitive overload, weak hierarchy, and inconsistent alignment, which dilutes the value for non‑technical users.

High‑impact improvements:
- Reduce initial cognitive load with a clear, prioritized layout and progressive disclosure.
- Consolidate redundant panels (two assistant surfaces) and tighten spacing.
- Make primary actions obvious, secondary insights discoverable, and keep decoration minimal.
- Standardize spacing, typography scale, and component density for legibility and touch.
- Ensure strong accessibility: color contrast, minimum hit targets, focus order, and RTL.

## Information Architecture & Layout

Observed (from Dashboard.tsx):
- Content order: Header → Dev toggles (DEV only) → Error/Offline banners → Onboarding Checklist → KPIs → Alerts (horizontal) → Assistant compact panel → Quick Actions → Setup Progress → Insights (Top Intents, Peak Times, Volume by Channel) → Ask the Dashboard (second assistant) → Industry Tiles → Sync Center (modal).
- Many sections with similar visual weight compete for attention. Two assistant entry points exist.

Recommendations:
- Primary zone (top):
  - Greeting + primary KPI strip (3–4 tiles, 2 columns) → 1 headline insight or alert cluster.
  - Keep this above the fold, with stable height across themes/devices.
- Secondary zone:
  - Quick Actions and Alerts. Deduplicate and group by intent (e.g., “Queues”, “Risks”).
- Guidance zone:
  - Onboarding Checklist (collapsible; show only when items remain). Provide explicit CTAs per step.
- Insights zone:
  - Top Intents, Peak Times, Volume by Channel in a 1–2 column grid with consistent card heights.
- Assistant:
  - Keep a single panel: the compact DashboardAskPanel, default collapsed, with a FAB to reopen.
  - Remove AskDashboard (duplicate) or convert it into a modal invoked by the same FAB when expanded.
- Contextual tiles:
  - IndustryTiles only if a pack is selected; place beneath insights, not above primary tasks.

Result: clear “Scan → Act → Explore” flow.

## Visual Hierarchy & Density

- Cards: Ensure consistent radii, border, and padding across all dashboard cards (you already use tokens, which is good). Target 16–20dp paddings inside cards, 12–16dp between UI elements.
- Typography scale: Use 14/16 as body sizes, 18/20 for section titles, 24 for headline KPI values. Avoid mixing multiple title sizes within the same view.
- Icon usage: Use icons sparingly and consistently (e.g., alert severity icons on AlertCard; no icons on every chip). Keep color semantics consistent (success/warning/error).
- Color: Preserve neutral background, elevate primary actions with color, and keep informational text muted. Avoid using bright colors for secondary components.
- Density: Limit above-the-fold to 2–3 visual groups. Everything else collapses or sits below a “More insights” boundary.

## Component‑Level Notes

### KPIs (KpiTile)
- Good: skeletons, deltas, targets. 
- Improve:
  - Label clarity: replace internal keys (e.g., `frtP50`) with friendly names (“Median first response time (p50)”). Provide units inline (min, sec).
  - Delta color contrast: ensure AA contrast on dark/light themes. Consider delta chevrons ▲▼ in addition to color.
  - Tap target: make whole tile pressable and route to a relevant detail screen. Provide haptic feedback.
  - Empty/loading: ensure skeleton height is consistent to prevent layout shift.

### Alerts (AlertCard)
- Good: horizontal list; clear counts.
- Improve:
  - Severity: add leading severity icon, consistent background tint (e.g., subtle warning tint for `slaRisk`).
  - CTA: add explicit button/chevron to clarify where it goes (avoid unexpected navigations).
  - Grouping: consider grouping alert kinds when many exist; avoid long horizontal scroll lists.

### Quick Actions
- Good: concise chip-like buttons.
- Improve:
  - Icons per action (e.g., filter icon for queues) for scanning.
  - Reprioritize to top 3 user tasks. Move others under “More”.
  - Keep label verbs (“Open urgent queue”, “Open SLA risk”).

### SetupProgressCard & Onboarding Checklist
- Consolidate onboarding into a single collapsible module:
  - Title: “Finish setting up” with percentage.
  - Each step with a CTA. When step completed, animate checkmark and shift it lower.
  - Auto-collapse once all steps are done; store this state.

### Insights (Top Intents, Peak Times, Volume by Channel)
- Good: simple, readable.
- Improve:
  - Chart affordance: add mini legends/labels. Use consistent axis labels and avoid bare “0/12/23” without context.
  - Tap reveals detail: drill into analytics or conversations filtered by that item.
  - Color: keep a single accent hue per view to avoid “rainbow effect”.

### Assistant (AskDashboard + DashboardAskPanel)
- Consolidate to one: keep DashboardAskPanel only.
- Default collapsed; open via FAB or recent queries strip.
- Use plain language suggestions tailored to persona (owner, ops, agent). You already scaffold persona/tone; surface it compactly with selectors.
- Avoid two assistant entry points to reduce confusion.

### IndustryTiles
- Good: contextual entry points.
- Improve:
  - Make them optional and personalized. If no pack, hide the section entirely.
  - Show as a 2‑column grid to reduce vertical height. Add small explanatory subtitles.

### Error/Offline Banners
- Good: non‑blocking banners.
- Improve:
  - Place banners in a reserved “system messages” zone at the top.
  - Use consistent iconography and concise language. Provide a “Details” or “Sync Center” link where relevant.

### Sync Center (modal)
- Good: clear content.
- Improve:
  - If offline actions exist, show a small pill/badge near a top‑right sync icon. 
  - Provide an option to retry items individually when implemented.

## Navigation & Language

- Names: You fixed duplicate screen names. Continue to use unique, descriptive names (e.g., “Conversations Home”).
- Copy: Favor plain language. Replace jargon/abbreviations (“SLA”, “p50”) with tooltips or expanded terms (“Service Level”, “median”).
- Deep‑links: When a tile navigates to a filter view, confirm visually with a chip (“Filter: VIP”). Provide clear back paths.

---

## Accessibility (WCAG/Platform Guidelines)

- Touch targets: Ensure all tappable controls meet 44×44dp minimum (many do; verify across chips and icons).
- Contrast: Verify color pairs (text/background, delta colors on both themes) reach AA (4.5:1 for normal, 3:1 for large text). Adjust tokens if needed.
- Focus order: Ensure logical traversal; screen readers should announce card titles before values. Add accessibilityLabels consistently (many are present—good).
- Dynamic Type: Respect user font scaling; avoid clipped text in cards and chips.
- RTL & Localization: You use i18n and localization. Confirm all left/right layout assumptions are mirrored (icons that indicate direction should flip). Avoid concatenated strings that break in RTL.

---

## Performance & Implementation Notes

- Virtualization: Large lists use FlatList already—good. Keep `initialNumToRender` reasonable and memoize heavy rows (you use React.memo in many components—good).
- Skeletons: Present but ensure consistent height to avoid layout shift.
- Re‑render control: Prop‑drill minimal updated values; avoid re‑creating arrays on every render where not needed.
- Charts: Current charts are simple views; as they grow, prefer lightweight chart libs or canvas‑backed primitives with memoization.
- Dev Toggles: Hide in production; consider a dedicated debug menu rather than on the main dashboard.

---

## Theming & Tokens

- Tokens are consistent and map to app theme—great. Codify component spacing consistently (e.g., 24dp section spacing, 16dp inner padding).
- Define semantic aliases where helpful: `surface/secondary`, `info`, `destructiveText`, `chipBg`, etc.
- Verify `accent` usage; today it’s a neutral shade but used as an answer container background—ensure contrast.

---

## Content Strategy & Empty States

- Provide friendly first‑run content:
  - KPIs: “Not enough data yet” with steps to generate data.
  - Alerts: “All clear” with what’s monitored.
  - Insights: “Insights appear after your first 50 messages.”
- Always offer a next step (“Connect a channel”, “Publish link”).

## Prioritized Action Plan

P0 — Structure & Clarity
- Remove duplicate assistant surface (keep DashboardAskPanel; default collapsed). 
- Reorder sections to Primary → Secondary → Guidance → Insights → Contextual.
- Collapse Onboarding when complete and store state.

P1 — Visual/Interaction Polish
- Standardize card paddings and font sizes across dashboard.
- Add icons + tints to Alerts; make CTA explicit.
- Add unit labels and friendly names for KPIs; add chevrons or explicit details CTA.
- Convert Quick Actions to icon chips; cap to top 3, overflow under “More”.

P2 — Accessibility & Performance
- Verify touch targets and contrast on both themes (AA); adjust tokens where needed.
- Confirm RTL mirroring and i18n coverage across dashboard strings.
- Keep skeleton heights consistent; memoize props on large lists.

P3 — Personalization & Optional Modules
- Hide IndustryTiles unless a pack is selected; show as 2‑column grid.
- Add a simple “Customize dashboard” mode to choose visible sections.

## Closing Notes

You have a solid foundation: consistent tokens, memoized components, and accessible labels in many places. The biggest gains now come from reducing on‑screen competition, consolidating duplicate surfaces, and tailoring the language and actions to non‑technical users. Apply the P0/P1 items first and perform a quick user walkthrough after each iteration to validate clarity.
